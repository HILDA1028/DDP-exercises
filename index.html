				<h3>Singing</h3>
				<p>Hilda is very fond of music. She likes to sing when she is in a good mood and also likes to sing to relieve herself when she is in a bad mood. She may not be a very good singer, she may not have a very good singing talent. But it doesn't matter to her, she just likes to sing.  By the way, her favourite singer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Iglesias" target="_blank">Enrique Iglesias</a>.</p>

				<h3>Dancing</h3>
			    <p>Hilda studied traditional Chinese dance for ten years before attending secondary school and obtained a Grade 10 certificate in Chinese dance. But unfortunately, Hilda gave up learning dance after she started secondary school. However, Hilda still loves dance, so she has decided to continue learning it in her spare time in the future. Now she is interested in K-pop dance.</p>
